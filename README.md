## üìã Project overview

*Eclat & Co* is a single-page/static website aimed at showcasing perfume products with a clean, responsive layout and smooth UI interactions. It is purposely minimal so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages without a build step.

### Key highlights

* Responsive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop
* Smooth interactions using vanilla JavaScript
* Simple folder structure so it's easy to maintain and deploy

## üöÄ How to use / deploy (short)

This repository is meant to be used as a static site. Typical flow:

1. Put the files in the project root (index.html, style.css, script.js and the images folder).
2. Add the `README.md` (this file) and optionally a `/screenshots` folder with `homepage.png` and `products.png`.
3. Initialize a Git repository locally and push to GitHub (create a repo named `eclat-and-co`).
4. Enable GitHub Pages for that repo (Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from branch `main` ‚Üí folder `/root`).
5. After a minute or two, your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/eclat-and-co/`.

> The exact commands and copy‚Äëpaste snippets for cloning, committing and pushing are included in the repository's deployment checklist section below.

---

## üì∏ Screenshots (how to add)

1. Open your site locally in a browser and take screenshots of the pages/sections you want to show.

   * Windows: `Win + Shift + S` (then paste into Paint and save) or use a screenshot tool.
   * Mac: `Cmd + Shift + 4`.
2. Create a folder named `/screenshots` in the repository root and save images as `homepage.png`, `products.png`.
3. Commit and push the screenshot files. GitHub will automatically render them inside this README.

---

## üîß Development / Local testing (recommended)

You don't need Node or any build system. To test locally with a simple web server (so routing and relative paths behave correctly), you can use one of the following commands in your project root:

* `python -m http.server 8000` (Python 3)
* or `npx http-server` (if you have Node installed)

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

---

## üì¶ .gitignore suggestion

Create a `.gitignore` file in the project root and include items like these (adjust if you add tools later):

```
# Node
node_modules/

# macOS
.DS_Store

# VS Code
.vscode/

# logs
npm-debug.log*
```

## ‚úÖ Deployment checklist (exact copyable commands)

> Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and run these commands in your project root (or copy them to a terminal). If you already created the repository on GitHub, replace the remote URL with the one GitHub shows you.

```bash
# 1) Initialize local git (only if not already a git repo)
git init

# 2) Add all files
git add .

# 3) Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Eclat & Co"

# 4) Create main branch and add remote (replace URL)
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/eclat-and-co.git

# 5) Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Enable GitHub Pages (once pushed)

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages** (or *Code and automation* ‚Üí *Pages* depending on UI updates).
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)` and save.
5. Wait 30‚Äì120 seconds, then visit `https://yourusername.github.io/eclat-and-co/`.

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

* If images don't show after deployment, check that your image paths in `index.html` are relative (e.g. `images/logo.png`) and the files are committed.
* If the site doesn't load, check the GitHub Pages section for build errors or messages.

---

## üìö Want me to do more?

If you want, I can:

* Generate a ready-to-paste `README.md` that exactly matches this file (so you can copy it into your repo). ‚úÖ
* Prepare optimized screenshot frames for better presentation in README.
* Walk you through the terminal commands step-by-step while you run them (I will not run anything for you).

Tell me which of the above you'd like next and I'll do it for you.
