## üìã Project overview

*Eclat & Co* is a single-page/static website aimed at showcasing perfume products with a clean, responsive layout and smooth UI interactions. It is purposely minimal so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages without a build step.

### Key highlights

* Responsive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop
* Smooth interactions using vanilla JavaScript
* Simple folder structure so it's easy to maintain and deploy

## üöÄ How to use / deploy (short)

This repository is meant to be used as a static site. Typical flow:

1. Put the files in the project root (index.html, style.css, script.js and the images folder).
2. Add the `README.md` (this file) and optionally a `/screenshots` folder with `homepage.png` and `products.png`.
3. Initialize a Git repository locally and push to GitHub (create a repo named `eclat-and-co`).
4. Enable GitHub Pages for that repo (Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from branch `main` ‚Üí folder `/root`).
5. After a minute or two, your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/eclat-and-co/`.

> The exact commands and copy‚Äëpaste snippets for cloning, committing and pushing are included in the repository's deployment checklist section below.

## üì∏ Screenshots (how to add)

1. Open your site locally in a browser and take screenshots of the pages/sections you want to show.

   * Windows: `Win + Shift + S` (then paste into Paint and save) or use a screenshot tool.
   * Mac: `Cmd + Shift + 4`.
2. Create a folder named `/screenshots` in the repository root and save images as `homepage.png`, `products.png`.
3. Commit and push the screenshot files. GitHub will automatically render them inside this README.

---

## üîß Development / Local testing (recommended)

You don't need Node or any build system. To test locally with a simple web server (so routing and relative paths behave correctly), you can use one of the following commands in your project root:

* `python -m http.server 8000` (Python 3)
* or `npx http-server` (if you have Node installed)

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

---

## üì¶ .gitignore suggestion

Create a `.gitignore` file in the project root and include items like these (adjust if you add tools later):

```
# Node
node_modules/

# macOS
.DS_Store

# VS Code
.vscode/

# logs
npm-debug.log*
```
